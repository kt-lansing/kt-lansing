# AmITheAsshole_ML Project for CS414
This project is contained in another GitHub Repository because it uses large file storage. Please see below for a quick summary and links to the project!

## Summary:
Given a text post on the subreddit r/AmITheAsshole, we trained a model to predict whether or not the Reddit community thinks that the poster of an AITA post is or is not the asshole. We used a Machine Learning pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis.
For this project, I was particularly impressed with my team's organization and ability to work together. Despite our project being less successful output-wise than we hoped, it was great experience using GitHub, Python and Machine Learning models. We also earned a great grade for our efforts which is always a plus!
